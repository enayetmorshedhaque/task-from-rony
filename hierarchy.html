              <p>
                ISOL’S THEORY OF THE HIERARCHY OF NEEDS CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOU
                THINK ABOUT SUCCESSFUL SERVICE DELIVERY. We have hierarchical
                selections that currently is represented as a wizard to the
                user. There is tree which can have many branches and each branch
                can have many leaves. For now I'm using table row span attribute
                and allow user to select branch associated with tree or leaf
                associated with branch.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another alternative is to use master-detail dropdowns so that by
                picking the branch the leaf dropdown is updated with available
                choices..
              </p>

              <p>
                Both of these seem not natural and frankly ugly. We were
                wondering if there is better way of doing this?
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Understanding The Guest Experience Hierarchy. In 1943, Abraham
                  Maslow published his theory of the hierarchy of needs, and his
                  psychology theory has profound applications to the hospitality
                  industry. As his treatise identified five sets of specific
                  individual needs, we’ll apply each to how your guests approach
                  an accommodation and how each subsequent level adds further
                  needs that are only important once all predecessors have been
                  satisfied.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Physiological needs. This level denotes the physical
                  accommodations your property delivers – a comfortable night’s
                  sleep, a functioning washroom for proper hygiene, essential
                  beverages like water and sustenance (note that this is
                  different from ‘food’ and ‘cuisine’). Also Safety needs. More
                  than just a door latch, safety means that you provide as
                  stress-free an environment as possible. For instance, guests
                  should not be woken by noisy people in the room next door.
                  They should not encounter disgusting characters in your lobby
                  as the security presence is both apparent and effective.
                  Guests should be reassured that their cars are not vandalized
                  in the parking lot. Finally, living in the digital age means
                  that their personal data and credit card information is not
                  willingly shared with third parties and that you have done
                  your due diligence to ward off hackers.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Social needs. This is the first category where service really
                  comes into play, especially when you take into account that
                  the other common name for this level is ‘love’.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Esteem needs. This fourth echelon of service is where
                  personalization starts to play a part. A typical example of
                  this is a loyalty program, where VIP’s are given a preferred
                  status, often with separate check-in, upgraded amenities and
                  additional onsite privileges. For example, your staff should
                  address guests by name when they pick up the in-room phone to
                  call for restaurant reservations. The general manager might
                  also compose a handwritten note on arrival with a welcome
                  refreshment. Recognition of a birthday, anniversary or major
                  life event also falls in this category. Lastly, its
                  magnificent head again as providing a fine dining experience,
                  above and beyond merely refilling one’s energy stores.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Satisfying The Guest Experience Hierarchy Self-actualization
                  is where you want to be, delivery of which typically results
                  in lifelong memories, extreme levels of positive sentiments
                  and solid loyalty. Naturally, commentary on Yelp, Trip Advisor
                  and other third-party review sites reflects these achievements
                  with enthusiastic and exceptionally compelling appraisals,
                  which will definitely help to convert future guests. Think of
                  these levels as building blocks, though. Remember, focusing on
                  any higher level within the hierarchy while letting any of the
                  lower levels slip will result in failure. Your restaurant
                  could be performing excellently, for instance, but if your
                  housekeeping is sloppy, the front desk agents are surly or the
                  air conditioning is noisy.
